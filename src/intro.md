# Entrance

Welcome to the mines, 

This book/wiki is broken into 4 parts

1. Theory
2. Practical Encoding
3. Filtering
4. Audio

## Theory

Here we will discuss why and what goals are important with encoding and swashbuckling to some degree as well as one of the most important transparency

See [Prospecting](./prospecting.md)

## Practical Encoding

Well once you have the knowledge of what encoding should achive and what what you want. Then we delve deeper into the cave. At how that applies to x264,x265, and SVT-AV1

See [Mining](./mining.md)

## Filtering

Not all sources are equal some are aweful riddled with artifacts so we need to filter and clean up these to improve the result and sometimes increase the psychovisual quality

See [Polishing](./polishing.md)

## Audio

Now one thing often neglected is the quality and size of the audio stream
